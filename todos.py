"""
DONE:
- create k-SDS
- correct k-SDS (look at the small map - what is going on there)
- prepare limit checks in k-SDS
- create k-MGDS
- prepare limit checks in k-MGDS
- improve new algorithms regarding small iterations (expansion of k for every 10 small iterations)
- insert message metric - n messages between physical steps
- insert neighbours metric
- check different time horizons (w) with different replanning periods (h)
- update k-MGDS and MGDS
- prepare saving functions for results
- create Dist-PrP algorithm
- for SDS and k-SDS: if neighbours didn't change their path - do not calculate once again the path!

TODO:
- implement more algorithms from literature
- make big experiments with the algorithms from literature
- export graphs
- finalize the paper
