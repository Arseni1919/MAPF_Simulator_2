"""
DONE:
- create k-SDS
- prepare limit checks in k-SDS
- create k-MGDS
- prepare limit checks in k-MGDS
- improve new algorithms regarding small iterations (expansion of k for every 10 small iterations)

TODO:
- insert message metric
- do big experiments with other algorithms
- implement more algorithms from literature
- make big experiments with the algorithms from literature
- export graphs
- prepare the paper
